                    <h1>Welcome to REV South E!</h1>
                    <p>Hey, there ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to UW Campus Housing and REV South E. As your don, I wanted to extend you a
                        warm
                        welcome!</p>
                    <h2>About REV South E</h2>
                    <p>Weâ€™re located on the ground floor of the south quad of Ron Edyt Village. As youâ€™re aware, this is
                        a
                        traditional style residence where residents have one roommate. The building is shaped like an
                        â€˜Lâ€™
                        where
                        one side is for male identifying students and one is for female identifying students. Each leg
                        of
                        the
                        â€˜Lâ€™ also has a single gender washroom.
                        <br><br>
                        For security reasons, you need a key to access the door and a separate key to access your room.
                        If
                        you
                        get locked out, you can get a loaner key from the 24/7 front desk for 20 minutes.
                        <br><br>
                        We have lounges on either side of the floor, however only one of them is equipped with a TV.
                        These
                        lounges are only accessible to people on our floor. For most community events, weâ€™ll use the
                        south
                        quad
                        general lounge which is a larger space.
                    </p>
                    <h2>A Message From Your Don</h2>
                    <p>My name is Gaurav and I will be the Don for our community this term. Iâ€™m looking forward to
                        getting
                        to
                        know each of you as individuals and as a community.
                        <br><br>
                        As your Don, I hope to create a space where we can grow as a community, develop some amazing
                        relationship, and create lasting memories. Throughout the term I will be reaching out to you to
                        get
                        to
                        know you, and see if there is anything that I can do to assist you in your transition into
                        residence.
                        <br><br>
                        I remember how anxious I was about moving into residence, starting a new chapter of my life at
                        uni
                        and
                        living away from home for the first time. If youâ€™re in a similar situation, I want you to know
                        that
                        youâ€™re not alone. It is a challenge, but I assure you, over time, you will come to like the
                        place
                        and
                        adjust. Till then, thereâ€™s lots of supports available for you which youâ€™ll find out more about
                        during
                        our first community meeting.
                    </p>
